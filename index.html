I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.

Reflection: I enjoyed working on this assignment and learned more about HTML structure.
