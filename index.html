Reflection: I enjoyed doing all this "tedious work". The most difficult part was the table.

        <h2>Haiokou</h2>
        <p>I thought about life and wrote this haikou, enjoy the good things our beautiful planet has, we are only here temporarly.</p>
        <p>A flower blooms brightly,<br>
        the world spins sliently<br>
        Sky and Sea is all we have.</p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>My mom instilled in me the passion for working out and staying active, when I was training(swimming) twice a day,
            these days it's not so extreme but I still make time to hike/gym/walk at least 3 or 4 times a week.</p>

        <p>I am a baker, I love how precising baking is, not to mention how delicious it can be. I prefer to bake with minimal sugar
            and added oils. I have created a variety of cakes, pies, pastries, cookies, you name it! </p>

        <p>I am currently on the process of learning how to garden. It is hard work but I have found it is an excellent
            contemplate and let my mind wander while I help plants grow, so far I've planted a bed of strawberries. </p>
